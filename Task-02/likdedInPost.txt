I'm eager to discuss the gains I've made in determining the ideal number of clusters. I was successful in reaching the ideal cluster number for the Iris Dataset's Target attribute.
Elbow curve method and Silhoutte Score are the two main methods for finding the cluster. And to determine the number of clusters, I uses the elbow curve method.

This was my second task under the @TheSparkFoundation.


Domain: Data Science & Business Analytics
